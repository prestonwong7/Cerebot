Cerebot is an automated script that uses Asana API and Google Drive API to automate repetitive processes used by the human-I-T company. Asana is widely used by human-I-T to inventory and edit items, so we found a much more efficient method. Cerebot has 3 features: inventory, wipe, destroy. All of these features basically move Asana tasks from one project to another and fills out its custom fields.
